# Covid-19-Data-Visualization-Using-Python
I worked with the COVID-19 Dataset consisting of data-related cumulative number of confirmed, recovered and death cases. The goal was to answer the following questions - 
1) How did the Global spread of the virus look like?
2) How intensive was the spread of the virus in different countries?
3) Did the Covid-19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries actually impact the COVID-19 transmission?
